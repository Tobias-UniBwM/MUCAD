    abstract       = {Tactical reconnaissance using small unmanned aerial vehicles has become a common military scenario. However, since their sensor systems are usually limited to rudimentary visual or thermal imaging, the detection of camouflaged objects can be a particularly hard challenge. With respect to SWaP-C criteria, multispectral sensors represent a promising solution to increase the spectral information that could lead to unveiling camouflage. Therefore, this paper investigates and evaluates the applicability of four well-known hyperspectral anomaly detection methods (RX, LRX, CRD, and AED) and a method developed by the authors called local point density (LPD) for near real-time camouflage detection in multispectral imagery based on a specially created dataset. Results show that all targets in the dataset could successfully be detected with an AUC greater than 0.9 by multiple methods, with some methods even reaching an AUC relatively close to 1.0 for certain targets. Yet, great variations in detection performance over all targets and methods were observed. The dataset was additionally enhanced by multiple vegetation indices (BNDVI, GNDVI, and NDRE), which resulted in generally higher detection performances of all methods. Overall, the results demonstrated the general applicability of the hyperspectral anomaly detection methods for camouflage detection in multispectral imagery.},
